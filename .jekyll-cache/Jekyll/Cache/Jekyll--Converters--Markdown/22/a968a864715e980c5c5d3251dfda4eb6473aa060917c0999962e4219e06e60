<p>We are a dynamic research group exploring <strong>sensory interactions</strong> to understand how humans <strong>perceive</strong> the world and build <strong>intelligence</strong>. In this quest, we resort to analyzing various kinds of digitized sensory signals. We think this exploration is critical for building futuristic intelligent human-machine interactions. Our game is to learn, grow and share our understanding and engineer an AI augmented future.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To know more about our planned explorations see <a href="research">Research</a>.</li>
  <li>To know about our findings see <a href="publications">Publications</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We are looking for passionate students (across undergraduate, Masters, and PhD) to join the team</strong> <a href="http://localhost:4000/vacancies">(more info)</a> <strong>!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our approach</strong><br />
We closely work with sound, speech, audio and EEG signals. We use signal processing, machine (deep) learning, behavioral and EEG experiments, and concepts and understanding from psychology, neuroscience and AI in our work.</p>

<li><details><summary>Sensing (click)</summary><quote>
  <details><summary>We are immersed in signals, and it is by sensing these signals that we get data into our brain. The biological sensors, like eyes and ears, have evolved to work under neurophysiological constraints. Exploring human intelligence by understanding the very first step of how a continuous-time (or space) signal (like image, sound, text, odor, etc.) is converted to a discrete sequence of samples in the peripheral sensory system will benefit the design of efficient sampling strategies for various kinds of sensory data.

<li> <details><summary>Perception (click)</summary><quote>
  <details><summary>The discrete sequence of samples are processed by the human brain to obtain quantitative (or qualitative) estimates of the attributes of the sensory signal. This process is referred to as perception. While listening to music we perceive the loudness, pitch, timbre, location, and distance etc., of the sound source. Similar estimates for other signals are obtained by us before we built a mental model the outside world. In certain ways, perception is analogous to feature extraction in machine learning. Knowing what humans perceive, and designing mathematical models which enables predicting human perception is a challenging problem in AI.

  <details><summary>The perceived attributes are utilized by the brain to build a mental model of the outside world. This is referred to as cognition, and one output of this is behavior. Understanding of cognition is important to design intelligent human-machine interactions.

<p>In our work we aim to unify these three concepts and using data science and AI, and attempt to understand how lifeforms (humans and other species) gain intelligence.</p>

<p>We are located in IIT Guwahati. Our campus is calm and vibrant, bio-diverse and fondly popular in India as (most!) heavenly (see <a href="pictures">Pictures</a>).</p>
