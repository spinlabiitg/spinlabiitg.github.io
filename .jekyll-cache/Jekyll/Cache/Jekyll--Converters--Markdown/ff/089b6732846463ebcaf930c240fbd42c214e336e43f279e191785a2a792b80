I"C<p>We are a dynamic research group exploring <strong>sensory interactions</strong> to understand how humans <strong>perceive</strong> the world and build <strong>intelligence</strong>. In this quest, we resort to analyzing various kinds of digitized sensory signals (and data). We think this exploration is critical for building futuristic intelligent human-machine interactions. Our game is to learn, grow and share our understanding and engineer an AI augmented future.</p>

<p>At SPIN Lab, we focus on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sensing: Signals are all around us. Our day-to-day activity is guided by how we sense them. The brain has to optmize the sensing process as it does not want to get overloaded with data and it  The same principle is followed by an electronic sensor. One difference between a human sensing a visual field compared to a camera doing the same task is that the human visual system does a context dependent sampling.<br />
Conversing with a friend, We are most of the time involved in some kind of sensory interaction with the outside world. Be it visual - starring at something, or auditory - listening to music, or haptic - rubbing our skin, or olfactory - smell of food. sensory interactions are all around us.  have been around for more than a billion years and have profoundly affected the forms, habits, destinies and evolution of the creatures. To this end, in our work, we conceptualize novel approaches to create (or use existing) datasets, develop algorithms and computational analysis pipelines, and engineer intelligent use cases.

<p>We are placed in the <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/dsai/">School of Data Science and AI</a>, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/eee/">Dept. EEE </a> and <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/clst/index.html">Center for Linguistic Science and Technology</a>, as well as with the colleagues from <a href="http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/">LEAP Lab, Indian Instititute of Science, Bangalore</a> and <a href="https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/habets">International Audio Labs, Erlangen, Germany</a>.</p>

<p>Our campus is calmy vibrant :), bio-diverse and fondly popular in India as (most!) heavenly. We are situated in the North-East India (see <a href="pictures">Pictures</a>).</p>

<p><strong>We are looking for passionate students (across undergarduate, Masters, and PhD), and Postdocs to join the team</strong> <a href="http://localhost:4000/vacancies">(more info)</a> <strong>!</strong></p>
