I"þ<p>We are a dynamic research group exploring <strong>sensory interactions</strong> to understand how humans <strong>perceive</strong> the world and build <strong>intelligence</strong>. In this quest, we resort to analyzing various kinds of digitized sensory signals (and data). We think this exploration is critical for building futuristic intelligent human-machine interactions. Our game is to learn, grow and share our understanding and engineer an AI augmented future.</p>

<p><strong>Sensing</strong><br />
Signals are all around us. Our day-to-day activity is guided by how we sense them. The biological sensors, like eyes and ears, have evolved to work under neurophysiological constraints. Exploring human intelligence by understanding the very first step of how a continuous-time (or space) signal (like image, sound, text, odour, etc.) is converted to a discrete sequence of samples in the peripheral sensory system will benefit design of efficient sampling strategies for various kinds of sensory data.</p>

<p><strong>Perception</strong><br />
The discrete sequence of samples are processed by the human brain to obtain quantitative (or qualitative) estimates of the attributes of the sensory signal. This process is referred to as perception. While listening to music we perceive the loudness, pitch, timbre, location, and distance etc., of the sound source. Similar estimates for other signals are obtained by us before we built a mental model the outside world. In certain ways, perception is analogous to feature extraction in machine learning. Knowing what humans perceive, and designing mathematical model which enables predcting human perception is a challenging problem in AI.</p>

<p><strong>Intelligence</strong><br />
The process of obtaining an estimate about the Conversing with a friend, We are most of the time involved in some kind of sensory interaction with the outside world. Be it visual - starring at something, or auditory - listening to music, or haptic - rubbing our skin, or olfactory - smell of food. sensory interactions are all around us.  have been around for more than a billion years and have profoundly affected the forms, habits, destinies and evolution of the creatures. To this end, in our work, we conceptualize novel approaches to create (or use existing) datasets, develop algorithms and computational analysis pipelines, and engineer intelligent use cases.
