I"ø<p>We are a dynamic research group exploring <strong>sensory interactions</strong> to understand how humans <strong>perceive</strong> the world and build <strong>intelligence</strong>. In this quest, we resort to analyzing various kinds of digitized sensory signals (and data). We think this exploration is critical for building futuristic intelligent human-machine interactions. Our game is to learn, grow and share our understanding and engineer an AI augmented future.</p>

<li> <details><summary>Sensing</summary><quote>
  <details><summary>We are immersed in signals, and it is by sensing these signals that we get data into our brain. The biological sensors, like eyes and ears, have evolved to work under neurophysiological constraints. Exploring human intelligence by understanding the very first step of how a continuous-time (or space) signal (like image, sound, text, odour, etc.) is converted to a discrete sequence of samples in the peripheral sensory system will benefit design of efficient sampling strategies for various kinds of sensory data.

</li>
<li> <details><summary>Perception</summary><quote>
  <details><summary>The discrete sequence of samples are processed by the human brain to obtain quantitative (or qualitative) estimates of the attributes of the sensory signal. This process is referred to as perception. While listening to music we perceive the loudness, pitch, timbre, location, and distance etc., of the sound source. Similar estimates for other signals are obtained by us before we built a mental model the outside world. In certain ways, perception is analogous to feature extraction in machine learning. Knowing what humans perceive, and designing mathematical model which enables predcting human perception is a challenging problem in AI.
