<p>Alongside excercising our brains, we enjoy discussing and working with individuals (and groups) with interests in solving impactful problems. We understand that recognizing impactful problems is an art, and systematically solving them requires interdisciplinary expertise. Feel free to send us an <a href="mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in">email</a> if you think together we can make an impact.</p>
