<p>We are placed in the School of Data Science and AI, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. Alongside excercising our brains, we enjoy discussing and working with individuals (and groups) with interests in solving impactful problems. We understand that recognizing impactful problems is an art, and systematically solving them requires interdisciplinary expertise. Feel free to send us an <a href="mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in">email</a> if you think together we can make an impact.</p>

<p>We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from Dept. EEE and Center for Linguistic Science and Technology. Outside campus, we work with Sriram Ganapathy (and <a href="http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/">LEAP Lab</a>) at the Indian Instititute of Science, Bangalore and [Emanuel Habets (and the International Audio Labs) at FAU, Erlangen.</p>
