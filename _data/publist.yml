  description: Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moir√© lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.

  image: web_paper_highlights_overlap_speech.png
  description: In real-world speech converstation recordings there are lot of instances at which multiple talkers are speaking simultaneously (that is, overlapping speech segments). Applications such as conversation analysis or recognition are adversely impacted by overlapping speech segments. An automatic detection (and annotation) of overlapping segments can be utilized to improve the performance. This paper proposes a solution.
