### Application for Postdoctoral Position
Currently, I (Neeraj) do not have funding to hire a postdoctoral researcher. We would be happy to open call for lab sponsored postdoc positions when I have it.

Meanwhile, I am happy to welcome postdoctoral researchers with sponsored fellowships. For example, take a look at the [National Postdoctoral Fellowship (India)](https://serbonline.in/SERB/npdf?HomePage=New) or the [Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://online.iitg.ac.in/ipdf/). If you are from outside India, you may find international fellowships to visit India. If you wish to discuss more, feel free to reach out to Neeraj by [email](mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in) expressing your interests.
**Important**: please insert "Application Postdoc" in the subject line.

### Visiting Scientist
There are options to become a Visiting Scientist/Faculty at IIT Guwahati. In case you are interested to work in areas of mutual interest by visiting us here in campus, feel free to [email](mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in). We will try to figure out ways to make it happen.
