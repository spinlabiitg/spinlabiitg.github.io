# Open positions

**We are currently open for Bachelors, Masters and PhDs.**

We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on challenges involved with determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving experimental setups, performing measurements and creating datasets, and making inventions and discoveries.

### Applications for PhD 
The IIT Guwahati enrolls new PhD students twice every year. If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student, please check the IIT Guwahati admission procedure at [this link](https://iitg.ac.in/acad/admission/). If you are already admitted into IIT Guwahati, then please send an [email](mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in) and Neeraj will be happy to schedule a meet with you. **Important**: Please insert "Application PhD" in the subject line.

### Bachelors and Master projects for IIT Guwahati students

### Applications for Postdoc
Currently, we do not have our own funding to hire a postdoc position, I'd be happy to support when I receive funding. In case you wish to plan for working with us as a postdoc, please send an [email](mailto:neerajww@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert "Application Postdoc" in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, please mention it in your email.

We especially welcome postdocs with fellowships. Take a look at the [National Postdoctoral Fellowship (India)](https://serbonline.in/SERB/npdf?HomePage=New) or the [Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://online.iitg.ac.in/ipdf/). If you are from outside India, in many countries, there are also fellowships available for outdoing postdocs. Please check those options as well.
