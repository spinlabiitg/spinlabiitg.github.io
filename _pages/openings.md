### Applications for Postdoc
Currently, we do not have our own funding to hire for a postdoc position, I'd be happy to support when I receive funding.

Meanwhile, we will welcome postdocs with fellowships. Take a look at the [National Postdoctoral Fellowship (India)](https://serbonline.in/SERB/npdf?HomePage=New) or the [Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://online.iitg.ac.in/ipdf/). If you are from outside India, in many countries, there are also fellowships available for outdoing postdocs. Please check those options as well. Feel free to inform us by [email](mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in) sharing your interest. State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. We will keep an eye on fellowship calls.
**Important**: please insert "Application Postdoc" in the subject line.
