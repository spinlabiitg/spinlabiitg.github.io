### Applications for Postdoc
Currently, I (Neeraj) do not have our own funding for a postdoc position. We would be happy to open call for postdoc positions when I receive funding.

Meanwhile, I am happy to welcome postdocs with sponsored fellowships. For example, take a look at the [National Postdoctoral Fellowship (India)](https://serbonline.in/SERB/npdf?HomePage=New) or the [Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://online.iitg.ac.in/ipdf/). If you are from outside India, in many countries, there are fellowships available for outdoing postdocs. Please check those options. If you wish to discuss more, feel free to reach out to Neeraj by [email](mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in) expressing your interest.
**Important**: please insert "Application Postdoc" in the subject line.
