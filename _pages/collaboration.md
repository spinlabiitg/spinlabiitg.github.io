# Collaboration

We are placed in the [Mehta School of Data Science and AI](https://www.iitg.ac.in/dsai/), Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. Alongside exercising our brains, we enjoy discussing and working with individuals (and groups) with interests in solving interesting and impactful problems. We understand that recognizing impactful problems requires know-how of multiple perspectives and systematically solving them requires interdisciplinary expertise. Feel free to send us an [email](mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in) if you think together we can make an impact.
 
#### Academic
We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from Dept. EEE and Center for Linguistic Science and Technology. Outside campus, we enjoy sharing knowledge and working with [Sriram Ganapathy](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) (and [LEAP Lab](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/)) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and [Emanuel Habets](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/habets) (and the [International Audio Labs](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/)) at Fraunhofer IIS, Erlangen.
 
#### Industry
Our research is always motivated with an engineering use case. If you are from domains like
- audio signal processing
- deep learning and AI for human machine communication
- brain computer interfacing
- signal processing for automotive
 
and will like to discuss options for collaboration, feel free to send us an [email](mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in).
