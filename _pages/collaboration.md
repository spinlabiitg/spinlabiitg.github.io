# Collaboration

We are placed in the [Mehta Family School of Data Science and AI](https://www.iitg.ac.in/dsai/), Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. Alongside exercising our brains, we enjoy discussing and working with individuals (and groups) with interests in solving interesting and impactful problems. Feel free to send us an [email](mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in) if you think together we can make an impact.
 
#### Academic
We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from Dept. EEE and Center for Linguistic Science and Technology. Outside campus, we enjoy sharing knowledge and working with [Sriram Ganapathy](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) (and [LEAP Lab](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/)) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and [Emanuel Habets](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/habets) (and the [International Audio Labs](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/)) at Fraunhofer IIS, Erlangen.
 
#### Industry
Our research is always motivated with an engineering use case. If you are from domains like
- audio processing for entertainment
- signal processing for automotive
- signal processing for healthcare
- AI for human-machine cognition
- Brain-computer interfacing
 
and will like to discuss options for collaboration/consultancy, feel free to send us an [email](mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in). Further, in case you wish to sponsor utilities as we setup our new lab, you are welcome!!

#### Outreach
Let us know by [email](mailto:neerajs@iitg.ac.in) if you would like us to share "about our research and findings'' at your School/College/Institute. We will try to see if we can fit the opportunity into our schedule.
